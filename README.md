# Documentation

## Introduction
### Motivation
- There's no personalized food choice service that fully automated in the market.

### Two Different goals
- Build the AI model could replace humans insight. (Restaurant recommendation model.)
- Build well architected robust web application.


## Prerequisite for this repository.
### Docs
1. Install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/)
2. Install Requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Just run `python3 architecture/main.py`

## Architecture


### IaC with golang
> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) brings automation to the provisioning process, which was traditionally done manually. Rather than relying on manually performed steps, both administrators and developers can instantiate infrastructure using configuration files. IaC helps avoid configuration drift through automation, and increases the speed and agility of infrastructure deployments. It also helps reduce errors and enhances the ability to apply changes through different stages consistently.

Jetbrains Youtrack is an issue-tracking tool that's mainly used by software developers to track, organize, and prioritize bugs, new features, and improvements for certain software releases. We host a youtrack instance on AWS EC2 and we've been using this since we built a team.

### Github organization

Our final goal is to launch product. We made a [github organization profile](https://github.com/AgileGradDev).
